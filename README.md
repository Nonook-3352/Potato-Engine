<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68b46e3b-32a3-4364-877c-2841bc3801f2"></img>

"Rewrite of the legacy version"</div>


# Thing to know :
- Potato Engine is just a passion project, don't expect a enteprise grade engine or api
- Expect bug and weird features that are not well documented
- I mostly add features for my use, but feel free to ask for some
- Expect weird lua code spagetti

## Current wiki (wip): (here)[https://github.com/Nonook-3352/Potato-Engine/wiki]

## Planned rewrite :
- Objects (doing it)
- Texture api and loading (doing it)
- Sprout and script system
- and more


## Thank to :
- Open Clipart for the Potato svg : https://freesvg.org/potato (gears made by myself)
- Github for hosting all of this shitty code
- The Love2D Framework for making the core of this engine : https://love2d.org

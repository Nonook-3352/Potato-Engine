= Lua-logger

== About

Lua-logger is a fork of
http://neopallium.github.com/lualogging/[LuaLogging] which is a port of
Log4j upon which it’s design was based. The name of the module was
changed by [@mwchase](https://github.com/mwchase) in his fork to
https://github.com/mwchase/log4l[`log4l`] to indicate the differences
and to assimilate other https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j#Ports[Log4j
ports’] names. I took [@mwchase's
version](https://github.com/mwchase/log4l) and made so many changes I
decided to publish it under my own domain. I decided to change the name
as well and I called the http://luarocks.org/[luarock] `logger`.

This is free software and uses the same license as Lua.

== Installation

With LuaRocks:

....
luarocks install logger
....

== Usage

Quick example:

[source,lua]
----
Logger = require('logger')
myLogger = Logger()

myLogger:debug('started logging stuff')
myLogger:info('this is just an info message')

myLogger:setLevel('ERROR') -- makes only error / fatal messages appended
myLogger:debug('this debug message should not be printed')
myLogger:info('another unprinted info message')
----

Requiring the `logger` module returns a logger `constructor'. There are
2 parameters the constructor accepts:

* Appender function
* Settings table

For example, it may accept these parameters like this:

[source,lua]
----
Logger = require('logger')
myLoggerSettings = {
  -- ...
}
myLoggerAppender = function(self, level, message)
end
myLogger = Logger(myLoggerAppender, myLoggerSettings)

-- ...
----

=== The appender function

The appender function should have this signature:

[source,lua]
----
function(self, level, message)
end
----

* `self` is the logger object himself.
* `level` is a string representation of the log level of the message.
* `message` is the message itself.

The default function prints the message to `io.stderr` along with
indicating the log level but you can write your own function that will
do whatever you want - append entries to a SQL database, send messages
via email etc..

You can also check for the current level of the logger in the appender
function using `self.level`. This variable is a string representation of
the log level. The default log levels are:

....
local DEFAULT_LEVELS = {
    -- The lowest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
    "OFF",
    -- Severe errors that cause premature termination. Expect these to be
    -- immediately visible on a status console.
    "FATAL",
    -- Other runtime errors or unexpected conditions. Expect these to be
    -- immediately visible on a status console.
    "ERROR",
    -- Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors, other runtime
    -- situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not necessarily
    -- "wrong". Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
    "WARN",
    -- Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown). Expect these to be
    -- immediately visible on a console, so be conservative and keep to a
    -- minimum.
    "INFO",
    -- Detailed information on the flow through the system. Expect these to be
    -- written to logs only. Generally speaking, most lines logged by your
    -- application should be written as DEBUG.
    "DEBUG",
    -- Most detailed information. Expect these to be written to logs only.
    "TRACE"
}
....

The order makes a difference: The index of Level `"OFF"` is `6` and
level `"TRACE"`’s index is `1` - *The lowest the number is - the more
detailed the message*. This design is Similar to that of Python’s
Logger, see
https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels[this
table].

Note that like `self.level`, `self.level_order` represents the numerical
order of the logger’s current log level.

=== The settings table

As noted above, the constructor accepts a second parameter which is the
settings table. This table may consist of 2 inner objects:

* `levels`: A table like the above `DEFAULT_LEVELS` but with a custom
set of levels names.
* `init_level`: A string of the log level the logger should start with.

=== Changing log level after initialization

You can change the log level after initialization with the following
method:

[source,lua]
----
myLogger:setLevel('ERROR') -- makes only error / fatal messages appended
----

This method accepts the log level either as a number or as a string. The
parameters `level` and `level_order` of `self` in the appender function
will update accordingly so it is recommended to use this rather then
manually changing the `myLogger`’s `level` and `level_order` fields.

=== Getting a level’s index by name

The Logger constructor creates a field in the returned logger called
`levelIndexByName` which may help you getting the numerical level of any
string level. Example:

[source,lua]
----
> myLogger = require('logger')()
> myLogger.levelIndexByName["WARN"] < myLogger.levelIndexByName["ERROR"]
true
----
